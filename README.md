# database-mongoDB-express-axios-phase
## Overview
- The point of this exercise is to help students to be able to set up an application from the ground up using Node.js, express, mongoDB, axios, and mongoose. It is important to know how to do this so students can apply their knowledge to their projects on the floor.

## Instructions
1. Open up the index.html file by right clicking on it in VS Code and selecting *Open with Live Server*. If this option does not pop up please ask an instructor for assistance.

2. Play around with the UI to get a feel for what exactly is going on in the web application. What problem is solved? What's the purpose of the application? What functionality does it have?

3. Now go to the database.js and make a comment at the top of the file explaining what the purpose of the file is.

4. Do the same for the index.html and the styles.css files. Make sure to also add any observations you've made about that file i.e. "The styles.css is organized by section and is separated by comments".

5. Lastly, go to the index.js file. For this file, write the purpose of each function at the top of the function in a comment. Then comment out line by line what is happening in that function and how it connects to the UI, i.e. "This line here binds the input field to the handleInput function so when I type in the input field the handleInput function is called."

6. Don't forget to add questions about the code that you have as well as critiques! My code isn't perfect so feel free to respectfully rip into it.

7. When you are done, submit your pull request to your instructor.
